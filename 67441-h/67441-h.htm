<span class="i2">The sloping hills of myrrh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trees with tender anise overweighed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The pointed flag-leaves stir<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Only to weep again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only to sob and mourn Adonis dead.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Throughout this dolorous night of cloudy jade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even the hornless dragon of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The green and golden sequined basilisk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The water-scorpion and the python-king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like sad eclipses trail about the land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crane, the ibis and the mango-bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The jungle-fowl, the heron and the roc,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The badger and three-footed tortoise join<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In pouring out their eyes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Cypris violet-stoled, O wrapped in purple woof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arise and beat your azure-veined breasts!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Small jewelled nipples, bleed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I have seen you make that curved mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bed of balsam, bed of crisp lush flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose poor crushed frozen lips compactly closed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lie, flakes of ice, where once were flakes of fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their loveliness a thing of agony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon has slanted off, and querulous ghosts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hover along the brink of treacherous voids<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leap into this night of blinded eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Blind now to pleasure’s lapping ecstasies);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This peacock-throated night whose stifling cries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shudder and crack: ’tis Misery who calls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Woe” to the black solemnities of sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For loveliest Adonis&mdash;he is dead.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Low on the hills he lies, the lovely bleeding one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His throat aflash with faint stunned strands of light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low on the hills he lies and breathes his life away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from his thigh of milk-white agate gashed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Slit by the cruel tusk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ruby blood drips down his skin of snow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath his brows stars set in crystal deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Once memories, hungers glinted in their pools),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are glazed dim, opaque and lustreless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blue orbs burn no more beneath translucent lids.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His locks are wet with the clear drops of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rose has fled his lip: the very kiss hangs dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kiss that Cypris never will forego.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And when the bitter white wind breaks the morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His gathered hounds bay gloom about his corpse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The green-haired Nereids of the marsh make moan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frail flowers dabble pollened cheeks with tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From vavicel to calyx petals weep....<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long spiral tufts of drooping galingale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shadowy deer-grass and the swallow-wort<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sob through their bat’s wing tissues tremulous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poplars weeping amber in the vales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The orchises and sandal-trees, lament.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Aphrodite with unbraided hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tragic thorn-pierced feet so delicate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calls through the woodlands and again, again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, more than music’s many stringèd charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His lulling name reverberates afar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where faint sails clasp the ribbands of the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But round his navel leaps the thick dark blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His chest is lapped in scarlet from the thighs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now purpled are those limbs afore as white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As veils of snow unflecked by merest breeze.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cypris was fair: whilst her Adonis lived<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But with Adonis has her beauty died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Died as a vaporous melody on a lute.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Woe, woe, for Cypris!” all the mountains call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The oak-trees answer: “For Adonis, woe!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Aphrodite all the rivers weep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wells bewail Adonis on the hills.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Echo resounds “Ai, ai ... Adonis dead ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most beautiful Adonis ... he is dead.”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Against his chilled inertness:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Farewell, Adonis; once, as I was telling<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Deluding tales of happiness, the morrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I had thought that joy had come for dwelling,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Came sorrow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The almoner of death, the silent creeper,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">For ever.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A widowed goddess with her beauty setting<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Her for ever.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For each blood drop the Paphian sheds a tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tears and blood on earth are turned to flowers:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ruby blood brings forth the pursy rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tears bring forth the air-white wind-flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For loveliest Adonis&mdash;he is dead.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No seemly couch, this lonely bed of leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For dead Adonis: beautiful in death<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The couch that yearns for wan Adonis’ limbs.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nay, all the flowers have faded in his death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As keen swift lovely murmurs drowned on breeze.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Graces grieve like mournful Autumn boughs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The toneless sound that means a broken heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Woe, for Adonis, son of Cinyrus!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him the Muses chant their starry music,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And painted insects floating motionless<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Bright feathered wings hung in the gloom of thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mimic the melancholy atmosphere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dry words start and rattle in the throat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shudder in sorrow; but he does not heed.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where clouds but catch the palest tinge of day,<br /></span>

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
